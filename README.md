# Tehran Air Quality Data Analysis & Visualization


## Overview
This project analyzes air quality data using Python. It provides insights into pollutant levels, trends, and possible correlations. The notebook leverages data science libraries for cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, making it useful for environmental studies and decision-making.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing (cleaning missing values, formatting)
- Exploratory data analysis (summary statistics, distributions)
- Time-series visualization of pollutants
- Correlation analysis between different air quality indicators
- Predictive modeling (if included in the notebook)

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
python 3.8+
jupyter
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn   # if ML models are used
